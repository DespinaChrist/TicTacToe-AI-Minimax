# TicTacToe-AI-Minimax
Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI built using the Minimax algorithm in Python.

## Description
This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game that allows a human player to play against an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make its moves. The game is built using Python and includes a simple GUI for the game board.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3 to be installed on your machine. Additionally, the following Python packages are required:
  - pygame
  
 You can install these packages using pip by running the following command:
```
pip install pygame
```
 
## Installation
To run the Tic Tac Toe game on your local machine clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/DespinaChrist/TicTacToe-AI-Minimax/
```
To run the game use the following command:
```
python runner.py
```

## Usage
To play the game, simply click on one of the squares on the game board to place your X or O. The AI opponent will automatically make its move after you have placed yours. The game will continue until either the human player wins, the AI opponent wins, or the game ends in a draw.

The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves, which guarantees that it will never lose the game. It is possible to tie the game against the AI, but it is impossible to win.

## Examples
Here are some screenshots of the game:
